The pointer in C++ language is a variable
also known as locator or indicator
that points to an address of a value.

A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address as its value.

Example
string food = "Pizza";  // A food variable of type string
string* ptr = &food;    // A pointer variable, with the name ptr, that stores the address of food
// Output the value of food (Pizza)
cout << food << "\n";
// Output the memory address of food (0x6dfed4)
cout << &food << "\n";
// Output the memory address of food with the pointer (0x6dfed4)
cout << ptr << "\n";

------------------------------------Advantage of pointer------------------------------------
1) Pointer reduces the code and improves the performance, it is used to retrieving strings, trees etc. and used with arrays, structures and functions.
2) We can return multiple values from function using pointer.
3) It makes you able to access any memory location in the computer's memory.

------------------------------------Get Memory Address and Value------------------------------------
Exmple:
string food = "Pizza";  // Variable declaration
string* ptr = &food;    // Pointer declaration
// Reference: Output the memory address of food with the pointer (0x6dfed4)
cout << ptr << "\n";
// Dereference: Output the value of food with the pointer (Pizza)
cout << *ptr << "\n";
